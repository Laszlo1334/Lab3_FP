Chapter 1. Text processing in programming

In real projects, developers often need to analyze long strings of text.
Sometimes these strings contain patterns like level, rotor, or civic that are
easy to recognize because they read the same forwards and backwards.
For more interesting tests, we can also construct multi-word palindromes.

For example, the sequence a b a is a simple palindrome that includes spaces.
An even longer artificial example is abc cba, where the space is part of the
pattern and the whole fragment still reads the same in both directions.
In practice, such exact patterns are rare, but they are very useful for testing.

Chapter 2. Whitespace and formatting

Input files may contain    multiple   spaces, 		tabs, and   irregular
line breaks. Before we search for palindromes, we usually normalize the text
by replacing any sequence of whitespace characters with a single space.
This makes patterns like a    b    a much easier to detect, because after
normalization they become a b a, which is clearly a palindrome.

Sometimes palindromes appear at the edges of words or sentences.
For instance, in the phrase "abcddcba is here", the substring abcddcba
is a long even-length palindrome. We can also hide palindromes in the
middle of a sentence, such as: here we see the fragment abccba inside this line.

Chapter 3. Summary and experiments

This sample input is long enough to test reading from a file, whitespace
normalization, and palindrome detection for both single words and phrases.
Your program should be able to find the longest palindromic substring
and also list all palindromic substrings that appear in the normalized text.
