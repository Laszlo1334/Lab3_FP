Chapter 1. Introduction to programming

In this chapter we discuss basic ideas about programs, data, and algorithms.
A string is a sequence of characters stored in memory.
Sometimes we need to analyze such strings and search for special patterns.
One interesting pattern is called a palindrome.
A palindrome reads the same from left to right and from right to left.
Classic examples are racecar, level, rotor, madam, civic and radar.
These words are often used in programming exercises about strings.

Chapter 2. Working with strings

When we work with text data, we usually read input from a file or from the keyboard.
Before processing the text, we often normalize it by trimming extra spaces and tabs.
For example, the text may contain    multiple    spaces,   tabs\t\tand empty   lines.
Normalization makes the text easier to handle for our algorithms.
After normalization, it is simpler to search for the longest palindromic substring.

Chapter 3. Palindrome examples

Sometimes a palindrome is not just a single word but a whole phrase.
A famous example is: a man a plan a canal panama.
If we ignore spaces and letter case, this phrase is a palindrome.
In this file we also include a short artificial example aba inside a sentence,
so that we can easily test whether our implementation finds it.
The goal of this assignment is to read the text from the file,
normalize whitespace, and then find the longest palindromic substring.
